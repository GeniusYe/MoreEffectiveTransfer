optionPreferLocalService	Prefer local district services
optionPreferLocalService_txt	Further improve locality of services by matching low priority requests only with service buildings within the same district (or outside any district). Once an unfulfilled requests becomes high priority, it will be served by any nearby service offer though. Affects: garbage, police, health care, maintenance, mail, taxi.
GROUP_WAREHOUSE_OPTIONS	Goods Delivery Options
optionWarehouseFirst	Warehouse First
optionWarehouseFirst_txt	Prefer to conduct all goods delivery (inbound and outbound) through warehouses, if available. Will increase warehouse traffic, so your warehouses better be situated strategically well.
optionWarehouseReserveTrucks	Reserve warehouse cargo trucks for local transfers
optionWarehouseReserveTrucks_txt	Recommended to enable with Warehouse First: reserve 25% of warehouse truck capacity for satisfying city demand, prevents all trucks being used for export.
optionWarehouseNewBalanced	Warehouse improved locality
optionWarehouseNewBalanced_txt	Warehouses on BALANCED mode will wait to buy from local warehouses or sell to local warehouse before deciding to import/export respectively. This should reduce unnecessary import/export and make intra-city warehouse transfers more reliable. Note that imports/exports will still happen. Does not change FILL/EMPTY mode behaviour.
GROUP_EXPORTIMPORT_OPTIONS	Export/Import Options
optionPreferExportShipPlaneTrain	Import/Export prefer to use ship/plane/train instead of highway
optionPreferExportShipPlaneTrain_txt	Experimental function!
