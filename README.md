# Inner workings

## Problems
There is obviously a conflict between the "higher priority first" approach and the "closed distance preferred" approach.
In particular, preferring matchmaking by closest distance cannot fully prevent that buildings get serviced by service buildings from far away.
That is because a more suitable, closer service offer might have already been matched to a higher priority request, so now the closer building has no choice but be matched with an offer from a service further away.

This whole situation cannot be easily prevented, and would rather require a complete redesign of the offer matchmaking system, with a "global optimization" approach (instead of the current "line-by-line, from high to low priority" approach).

TLDR: you notice in your city that garbage trucks go from A to B, and from B to A, and you think this mod is not doing its' job. C'est la vie - this mod usually reduces these situations a lot, but cannot fully prevent them.
